# Word Frequency Analyzer using NLTK

This project analyzes the **frequency of words** in a given text using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). It tokenizes the text into individual words, converts them to lowercase for uniformity, removes punctuation, and counts how many times each word appears.

## Features

- Computes the frequency of all words in a text.
- Displays the **most common words** for quick insights.
- Can be used for text analysis, natural language processing, or content summarization.
